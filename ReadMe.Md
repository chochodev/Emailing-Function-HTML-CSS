## ID.me

#### This is just a practice html-css-js project for email sending with smtp-js.

* It assumes that the website has a backend which I will build sometime in the future that scans and verify the authenticity of a card inputed.
* But it actually sends an email to of the details inputed to my email.
* I didn't do much on the frontend and focused on the emailing part.
